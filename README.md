# ASP.NET-Core-Crud

This is an Employee management project 

This project is made of ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core, HTML and a little bit of Bootstrap.

Here I have performed 
1. Create 
2. Read 
3. Update and 
4. Delete operations 

As server I've used MSSQL Server.

I will implement rule based authentication very soon in this project.
